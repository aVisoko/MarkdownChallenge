#### This is my first markdown challenge in my INFOTC 2600 class!

To see a few of my *hobbies* feel free to click [here](https://github.com/aVisoko/MarkdownChallenge/blob/master/Hobbies.md)

It's fun to use markdown you can even highlight code as shown below!
```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("HelloWorld")
puts markdown.to_html
```
