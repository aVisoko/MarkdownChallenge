#### This is my first markdown challenge in my INFOTC 2600 class!

To see a few of my *hobbies* feel free to click [here](https://github.com/aVisoko/MarkdownChallenge/blob/master/Hobbies.md)

It's fun to use markdown you can even highlight code as shown below!
```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("HelloWorld")
puts markdown.to_html
```
## You can even use tables in Markdown to help display information

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
