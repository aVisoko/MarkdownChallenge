## These are a few of the things that I like to do in my free time

My all time favorite thing to do when I'm not working as a bartender or being studious with school work, is to stream video games. I typically play and stream **Fortnite** on **[Twitch!](https://www.twitch.tv/aVisoko)**

I used to play ~~console~~ but now I strictly play on PC with a rig that I recently built myself.
